This is a simon game web site I made for the Angela Yu's web developer bootcamp in Udemy. I'll use HTML, CSS and jQuery

Simon game

The simon game consists in four buttons (green, yellow, red and blue). Simon will give you an order (to push a button) each turn which you have to repeat the next turn successively. 

For example:
Simon: red
Player: red
Simon: blue
Player: red blue
Simon: yellow
Player: red blue yellow
etc

How to play:
1) Press the "A" key to start the game.
2) Once the game has started you will see the Simon Command.
3) Repeat the commands Simon gives you each turn.
4) Be careful! if you forget just one step you will lose and the game will start over.

Hope you enjoy the game. it was really fun to make.
